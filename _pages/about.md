I'm a third year Master Student from [School of Soft Engineering](http://se.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhao](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/guoshuai.zhao) of Smiles Lab from [School of Computer Science](http://www.smiles-xjtu.com/), Xi'an Jiaotong University. I was the visiting student working with Dr. [Li-wei H. Lehman](https://web.mit.edu/lilehman/www/) in  [Institute for Medical Engineering & Science (IMES)](http://imes.mit.edu/), MIT. My research interest includes Time series, Generative Modeling, Machine Learning, representation learning, Self-supervised learning and AI for Healthcare.

## Research interest

1. Time Series Modeling by Deep Learning Methods, including more efficient representation learning, transfer learning.
2. AI for Healthcare, specially in EHR signal analyzing and clinical decision-making, by using conformal prediction and counterfactual prediction.
3. Generative model for time-series data, including Diffusion model or GAN.
