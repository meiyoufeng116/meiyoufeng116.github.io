I'm a third year Master student from [School of Soft Engineering](http://se.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Time series, Generative AI, machine learning, and AI for Healthcare.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhao](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/guoshuai.zhao) of Smiles Lab from [School of Computer Science](http://www.smiles-xjtu.com/), Xi'an Jiaotong University.
